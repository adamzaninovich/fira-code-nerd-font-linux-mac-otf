# Fira Code Nerd Font

These are the Fira Code fonts from https://nerdfonts.com

I've only included the correct versions for Linux and macOS in the OTF format

Choose either Ligatures or Mono and install the whole set

You can usually use the following family name (for example in alacritty.yml)

```yml
font:
  normal:
    family: "FiraCode Nerd Font"
    style: Retina
```
